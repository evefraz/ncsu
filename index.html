		<p>
			I am currently a first-year planning to major in <strong>computer science</strong>.
			I chose computer science because of its applications in so many fields,
			and I find technology very <em>interesting</em>.
			Along with computer science, I am hoping to minor in <ins>cognitive science</ins>.

			Prior to attending NCSU, I worked as a lifeguard at a lake and as a hostess at a local
			brewery. Lifeguarding was a lot more enjoyable than working in the restaurant business,
			but I had fun at both jobs. My dream job would probably be doing research surrounding
			machine learning, but I am also interested in data analysis.
